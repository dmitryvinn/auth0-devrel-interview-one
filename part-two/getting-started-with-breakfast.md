# Getting Started with Keto Breakfast

Many [articles](https://bit.ly/2CqeUKp) online claim the importance of an established morning routine. We can argue whether studies referenced in these posts are legitimate, but very few would argue with the joy of a healthy (read, "keto") breakfast. I am a firm believer that a good breakfast is a [small win](https://bit.ly/2Gu6jKN) that sets the rest of your day in motion.

## Recipe of the Day: Classic Bacon and Eggs

You might not believe it, but your classic breakfast, bacon and eggs, is good for you!
Even better is the fact that it only takes about 10 minutes to prepare this low-carb dish, and it doesn`t require you to be a Michelin star chef.

### Cookware

* Fry Pan with Lid
* Knife(s)
* Fork(s)

### Ingredients

* Eggs
* Slices of bacon
* Cherry tomatoes

**Note**: For more detailed nutritional information and to help you measure the ingredients required, go to [Diet Doctor].

## Instructions

1) Use a pan at medium heat to fry the bacon until it is crispy. After the bacon is done, put it on the side of your place.

2) Fry eggs in the same pan at medium heat with the pan lid closed. This way your eggs will be cooked sunny side up.

3) Cut the cherry tomatoes in half. You can fry them in the same pan, or eat them fresh with the bacon and eggs.

4) Add salt and pepper to your liking.

You can find a short overview of the keto diet with pointers to further reading if you are interested to know about this new dietary movement.

### What is the keto diet

[Keto diet](https://bit.ly/2F4mSe9) is a low-carb diet which aims to use fats and proteins as the primary energy source. When you minimize your sugar intake, your body goes into a  state of ketosis (hence, the name of the diet, keto diet) when your cells are deprived of carbohydrates and adapt to other macro-molecules from foods rich in fat and proteins.

### Why follow the keto diet

While it might sound like another fad in an array of new diets which have been popularized in the last few years, the keto diet has shown to reduce chances of brain disorders, help with a faster weight reduction, and to improve sugar control with type 2 diabetes.
