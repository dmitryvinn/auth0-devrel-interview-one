# Plug and Play Authentication with Auth0 Lock

Whatever my qualifications or hobbies might be, I am first and foremost a  software developer. And as a software developer who was hurt way too many times by complexities of things like timezones or payment processing, I've learned to appreciate the difficulty of identity management.

This major security challenge is where [Auth0] comes in with its [Lock] product - a plug-and-play authentication system that supports social, corporate and other means of authentication.

With the [Lock], you can embed this highly customizable login form into your mobile, desktop or web app so that you can focus your efforts on other parts of your business. This authentication widget from Auth0 helps you to work on achieving your business' goals without compromising on the security of your product.
