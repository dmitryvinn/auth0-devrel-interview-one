# Auth0 Developer Experience Advocate Interview - Stage 1

As a part of the interview process for a developer experience advocate role at Auth0, I needed to complete a written assignment. The assignment had two parts:

1) *Describe a favourite product at Auth0.*

I chose to talk about Lock and the full response can be found [here](https://github.com/dmitryvinn/auth0-devrel-interview-one/blob/master/part-one/about-auth0-lock.md).

2) *Create a short instruction ("Getting Started" style) of your daily breakfast.*

As a person who tries to eat a low-carb diet, I outlined how to make a simple, keto breakfast. See my post [here](https://github.com/dmitryvinn/auth0-devrel-interview-one/blob/master/part-two/getting-started-with-breakfast.md).
